## New Features

### Webhook Support

Added support for webhook event handling:

```javascript
client.webhooks.on('user.created', (event) => {
  console.log('New user:', event.data.user);
});
```

### Rate Limit Headers

Response objects now include rate limit information:

```javascript
const response = await client.users.list();
console.log(response.rateLimit.remaining); // 99
console.log(response.rateLimit.reset); // Unix timestamp
```

## Improvements

## Deprecations

The following methods are deprecated and will be removed in v2.0:
