## Highlights

This major release brings significant performance improvements and a redesigned API surface. We've also added first-class TypeScript support.

## Breaking Changes

### New Client Initialization

The client initialization has been simplified:

```javascript
// Before (v1.x)
import { createClient } from '@acme/sdk';
const client = createClient({ apiKey: 'xxx', region: 'us-west' });

// After (v2.0)
import { AcmeClient } from '@acme/sdk';
const client = new AcmeClient('xxx', { region: 'us-west' });
```

### Removed Deprecated Methods

The following deprecated methods have been removed:
- `client.legacyFetch()` - Use `client.fetch()` instead
- `client.setConfig()` - Pass config to constructor instead

## New Features

- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript definitions with strict mode support
- **Streaming API**: New streaming endpoints for real-time data
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Request Batching**: Batch multiple requests for improved performance

## Performance

- 50% reduction in bundle size
- 3x faster cold start times
- Reduced memory footprint
