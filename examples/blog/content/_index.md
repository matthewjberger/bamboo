Hey, I'm Richard. I write about software engineering, compression algorithms, and my journey building a decentralized internet.

Currently the CEO of Pied Piper, working on middle-out compression and peer-to-peer networking. This blog is where I share technical deep dives, lessons learned from startup life, and the occasional rant about tabs vs spaces.
