## About Me

I'm Richard Hendricks, a software engineer and entrepreneur based in Silicon Valley. I'm the founder and CEO of Pied Piper, where we're building a new decentralized internet powered by middle-out compression.

## Background

I studied computer science at Stanford (dropped out) and spent a few years at Hooli before starting Pied Piper. My main interests are:

- **Compression algorithms** - Particularly lossless compression and the theoretical limits of data encoding
- **Distributed systems** - Peer-to-peer networks, consensus protocols, and decentralization
- **Low-level programming** - Systems programming, performance optimization, and understanding what's happening at the metal

## This Blog

I started this blog to document my technical learnings and share insights from building a startup. Topics range from deep dives into algorithms to practical engineering advice to the occasional reflection on the tech industry.
