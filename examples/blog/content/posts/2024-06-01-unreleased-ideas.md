This is a draft post that explores some ideas I'm not ready to share publicly yet.

## Quantum-Resistant Compression

With quantum computing on the horizon, we need to think about how our compression algorithms will hold up. Current approaches rely on classical assumptions about computational complexity that may not apply in a post-quantum world.

## Neural Compression

What if we trained a neural network on our middle-out approach? Early experiments show promising results, but the inference cost is still too high for production use.

## Decentralized Storage v2

PiperNet works, but it's not as fast as centralized alternatives for small files. We need a hybrid approach that can match cloud storage latency for files under 1MB while maintaining our decentralization guarantees for larger datasets.

These are all still in the "thinking about it" phase. More to come when we have concrete plans.
