After years of keeping technical notes in private Google Docs and scattered markdown files, I've decided to start sharing publicly.

## Why Now?

Building Pied Piper has taught me more about software engineering than my entire career before it. The problems we solve daily—compression at scale, distributed consensus, peer-to-peer networking—are fascinating, and I think others might find our learnings useful.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Deep technical content** - Algorithm breakdowns, performance optimization, systems design
- **Startup lessons** - What I've learned building a company (mostly what *not* to do)
- **Industry observations** - Thoughts on where tech is heading

## A Note on Writing

I'm not a natural writer. I think in code, not prose. But I believe the discipline of explaining complex ideas in simple terms makes you understand them better. If nothing else, future me will appreciate having these notes.

Let's see where this goes.
