# Design System

A comprehensive design system built for Enterprise Corp's suite of internal tools, serving over 5,000 employees.

## Challenge

Enterprise Corp had dozens of internal applications, each with inconsistent UI and different component libraries. This led to:

- Duplicated development effort
- Inconsistent user experience
- Difficulty onboarding new team members
- Accessibility compliance issues

## Solution

I led the creation of "Nucleus", a design system that includes:

### Component Library
50+ React components built with TypeScript, fully accessible and themeable.

### Design Tokens
A token-based system for colors, typography, spacing, and motion that syncs between Figma and code.

### Documentation
Comprehensive documentation with usage guidelines, code examples, and do/don't examples.

### Figma Library
A complete Figma component library with variants, auto-layout, and design tokens integration.

## Implementation

- Gradual rollout starting with highest-traffic applications
- Weekly office hours for team support
- Contribution guidelines for new components
- Automated visual regression testing

## Results

- 60% reduction in design-to-development time
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all applications
- 90% component adoption within 6 months
- Design consistency score improved from 45% to 92%
