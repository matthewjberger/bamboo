# Mobile App Redesign

A ground-up redesign of HealthTrack's iOS and Android applications, focusing on user engagement and ease of use.

## Challenge

HealthTrack's existing app had low user retention and poor App Store ratings. Users found the interface confusing and the onboarding process too lengthy.

## Process

1. **User Research**: Conducted interviews with 20 existing users
2. **Competitive Analysis**: Analyzed top health apps in the market
3. **Wireframing**: Created low-fidelity wireframes for key flows
4. **Prototyping**: Built interactive prototypes in Figma
5. **Testing**: Ran usability tests with 15 participants
6. **Iteration**: Refined designs based on feedback

## Key Features

- Simplified onboarding (reduced from 8 screens to 3)
- Dashboard redesign with personalized insights
- New activity tracking with visual progress
- Social features for accountability
- Dark mode support

## Results

- App Store rating improved from 2.8 to 4.6 stars
- User retention increased by 60%
- Daily active users grew by 120%
- Featured in App Store "Apps We Love"
