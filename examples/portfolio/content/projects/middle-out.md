The core compression algorithm that started it all. Achieves a 5.2 Weissman score through revolutionary middle-out approach.

## Overview

Middle-out compression is a novel approach to lossless data compression that processes data from the middle outward, achieving unprecedented compression ratios while maintaining fast decompression speeds.

## Key Features

- Unprecedented 5.2 Weissman score
- Lossless compression with no data loss
- Fast decompression for real-time applications
- Scalable to any data size
