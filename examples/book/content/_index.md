# The Rust Cookbook

Welcome to **The Rust Cookbook**, a practical guide to common programming tasks in Rust. This book provides concise, example-driven recipes for solving everyday problems you'll encounter while building real-world applications.

## Who This Book Is For

This book assumes basic familiarity with Rust syntax. If you've read through the first few chapters of *The Rust Programming Language*, you have everything you need to get started here.

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter is self-contained. You don't need to read them in order — feel free to jump to whatever topic is relevant to your current project. That said, the chapters are organized in a progression that builds naturally from fundamentals to more advanced topics.

## What You'll Learn

- **Fundamentals** — Error handling, data structures, and the type system
- **Working with Data** — Serialization, parsing, and file I/O
- **Networking** — HTTP clients, servers, and async programming
- **Systems Programming** — Concurrency, FFI, and command-line tools
- **Testing & Tooling** — Unit tests, benchmarks, and CI integration

## Running the Examples

Every code example in this book can be run directly. Clone the companion repository and use `cargo run --example` to try any recipe:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rust-cookbook/rust-cookbook
cd rust-cookbook
cargo run --example error_handling_basics
```

Let's get started.
